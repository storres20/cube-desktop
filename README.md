# CUBE-DESKTOP: Desktop App for Real-Time LoRa Telemetry Monitoring

**CUBE-DESKTOP** is a cross-platform desktop application designed for real-time visualization of telemetry data sent from a LoRa transmitter during free-fall experiments, such as in CubeSat or aerial drop simulations. The LoRa transmitter sends environmental data to a ground LoRa receiver connected via USB to a PC or laptop running this application.

Developed using Python and Tkinter, the app provides live plotting, historical logging, and CSV export capabilities for received data, enabling reliable and user-friendly field testing.
